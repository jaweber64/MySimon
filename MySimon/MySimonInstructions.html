    	<b style="color:#000066;">MySimon</b> is a game based on the original Simon (an electronic game of memory 
    	skill originally manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley but now manufactured 
    	by Hasbro).<br><br>
    	
       <b style="font-family:MarkerFelt-Wide;">Classic Game Play Summary:</b><br><br>
	<b style="color:#000066;">MySimon</b> begins by offering one tone/color that the player must match.  
	Upon a successful match, one tone/color is added to the sequence.  And so on.  There are ten possible 
	levels to proceed through.  Completing level 10 is a WIN! <br><br>
